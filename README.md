# Map-Reduce-Operations-Java-Threads

A Java project that simulates specific Map-Reduce operations on a set of texts and ranks them in accordance with the lengths and frequencies of their words. 

The project uses **Java Threads** to code map and reduce operations that are solved by multiple workers simultaneously. The workers are represented by classes that implement the **Runnable interface** and **avoid race conditions**.
